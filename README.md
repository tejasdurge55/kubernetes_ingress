# ðŸš€ Ingress Web App Deployment on Kubernetes

This project demonstrates how to deploy an Ingress web app on Kubernetes using YAML configuration files.

## Prerequisites
- Kubernetes cluster up and running.
- `kubectl` command-line tool installed and configured.
- minkube users having docker driver should enabele ingress using:
   ```minikube addons enable ingress```
  
  

#### ðŸ›  Skills Required:
- Kubernetes Basics
- Docker

## Deploying the Ingress Web App

### Step 1: Deploy the Demo Applications
You can deploy the applications using the following Kubernetes deployment file "deployment.yaml" :

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: demo1
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: demo1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: demo1
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: demo1
        image: tejasdurge55/dice_app
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80   #port of the container
#nginx websever has been utilised inside the application as nginx runs on port 80 we need to define containerPort: 80

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: demo2
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: demo2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: demo2
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: demo2
        image: tejasdurge55/automated_apache_server
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80   #port of the container
#nginx websever has been utilised inside the application as nginx runs on port 80 we need to define containerPort: 80
```

### Step 2: Create Services for the Deployments
Create Kubernetes services for the deployed applications:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: tea-svc
spec:
  selector:
    app: demo1
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 801  #port of the service 
      targetPort: 80  #port of the container #containerPort=targetPort #basically port 80 of container is connected to port 801 of service
  type: ClusterIP 

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: coffee-svc
spec:
  selector:
    app: demo2
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 801  #port of the service 
      targetPort: 80  #port of the container #containerPort=targetPort #basically port 80 of container is connected to port 801 of service
  type: ClusterIP

```

### Step 3: Configure Ingress
Configure the Ingress resource to route traffic to the deployed services based on specific paths:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: service-a
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
  - host: public.my-services.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /(.*)
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: tea-svc
            port:
              number: 801  #port of service #basically all "domain-name/" requests would be forwarded to port of service 
                            #but only forwarded to tea-svc service that contains the dice app
      - path: /gift/(.*)
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: coffee-svc
            port:
              number: 801  #port of service #basically all "domain-name/gift/" requests would be forwarded to port of service 
                            #but only forwarded to coffee-svc service that contains the gift app
```

## Deploying the Configuration
Apply the configuration files to your Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl apply -f <file>`.
Make sure to replace `<file>` with the actual file name.
```
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml
```
## Changing hosts file in your PC to access the domain
Windows users should navigate to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc and change the hosts file such that:
```
# Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual
# lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.
#
# For example:
#
#      102.54.94.97     rhino.acme.com          # source server
#       38.25.63.10     x.acme.com              # x client host

# localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.
#	127.0.0.1       localhost
#	::1             localhost
```
should be changed to :
```
# Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual
# lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.
#
# For example:
#
#      102.54.94.97     rhino.acme.com          # source server
#       38.25.63.10     x.acme.com              # x client host
          127.0.0.1     public.my-services.com
# localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.
#	127.0.0.1       localhost
#	::1             localhost
```
## Accessing Your Ingress Web App
Once deployed and configured, you can access your Ingress web app using the specified host and paths.

Minikube with docker driver should use the following command to enable port-forwarding from minikube to local computer:
```minikube tunnel```

Example:
- http://public.my-services.com/
- http://public.my-services.com/gift/
